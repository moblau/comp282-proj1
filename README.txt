README for Project 1
1. The largest number of words I was able to test with was 95000. For files larger than this, the program would not finish running. This is because the linked list reversal is O(N^2) which takes a long time for a large value of N.
2. The runtime for the array in-place reversal for 95000 words was 0.01474 seconds.
3. The runtime for the linked list reversal for 95000 words was 185.1 seconds.
4. The runtime for the queue/stack reversal for 95000 words was 9.205 seconds.
5. The runtime for the array in-place reversal for 47500 words was 0.003648 seconds.
6. The runtime for the linked list reversal for 47500 words was 23.19 seconds.
7. The runtime for the queue/stack reversal for 47500 words was 2.548 seconds.
8. The runtime for the array in-place reversal for 23750 words was 0.004084 seconds.
9. The runtime for the linked list reversal for 23750 words was 1.5478 seconds.
10. The runtime for the queue/stack reversal for 23750 words was 0.6085 seconds.
11. The runtime for the array in-place reversal is the correct strategy for reversal. It was much faster than both the linked list reversal and the queue/stack reversal.
